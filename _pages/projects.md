Summer 2020 - [Source Code and Documentation](https://github.com/bcguzy/Weather_Sprinkler)  
This was my main project during the summer and combined the knowledge gained from previous API and hardware projects this summer. It takes rainfall data from the OpenWeatherMap API to determine if a plant needs more water that day or not. I used an ESP8266 NodeMCU, the motor shield for the ESP8266 for easy power delivery, a 9 volt battery for a power source, and a 9v solenoid valve to control water flow. This could be further miniaturized by using only the ESP8266 chip without the development board and using a small power management board instead of the full motor shield.

## WiFi Button Sprinkler

This project is a button hosted on the local network that can be used to turn on and off a sprinkler remotely. This project helped me get familiar with connecting the ESP8266 to WiFi and successfully powering the solenoid valve using the motor shield. All of this knowledge was used in the WiFi Weather Sprinkler project.

Summer 2020 - [Source Code and Documentation](https://github.com/bcguzy/Brandons-Responsive-Weather) - [View Website Here](https://bcguzy.github.io/Brandons-Responsive-Weather/)  
I started this project as an experiment and exploration into web design and APIs. The site uses bootstrap CSS, openweathermap API for the weather data, and owfont for the icons. During the process of making this website, I learned a lot about using REST APIs, responsive web design, JavaScript, and HTML. My knowledge of APIs and HTML gained from this project helped me with future projects in the Summer.
