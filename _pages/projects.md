## AVR Thermometer

Fall 2020  
This project was made as part of my Embedded Systems class and uses the ATmega 4809 coded with the AVR instruction set. This project involved using many parts of the ATmega 4809 microprocessor including the analog to digital converter for the temperature sensor, the timer/counters on the chip for interrupts, and of course utilizing the I/O pins. I also learned about reading and using documentation for microprocessors, their instruction sets, and basic components for the circuit. Subroutines provided from the manufacturer were researched and used for multiplication and division of the ADC results to convert them to degrees Celsius. This project made me much more confident in working with embedded systems and using technical documentation.

## WiFi Weather Sprinkler

Summer 2020 - [Source Code and Documentation](https://github.com/bcguzy/Weather_Sprinkler)  
This was my main project during the summer and combined the knowledge gained from previous API and hardware projects this summer. It takes rainfall data from the OpenWeatherMap API to determine if a plant needs more water that day or not. I used an ESP8266 NodeMCU, the motor shield for the ESP8266 for easy power delivery, a 9 volt battery for a power source, and a 9v solenoid valve to control water flow. This could be further miniaturized by using only the ESP8266 chip without the development board and using a small power management board instead of the full motor shield.

## WiFi Button Sprinkler

Summer 2020 - [Source Code and Documentation](https://github.com/bcguzy/WebButton_Sprinkler)  
This project is a button hosted on the local network that can be used to turn on and off a sprinkler remotely. This project helped me get familiar with connecting the ESP8266 to WiFi and successfully powering the solenoid valve using the motor shield. All of this knowledge was used in the WiFi Weather Sprinkler project.

## [Responsive Weather](https://bcguzy.github.io/Brandons-Responsive-Weather/)

Summer 2020 - [Source Code and Documentation](https://github.com/bcguzy/Brandons-Responsive-Weather) - [View Website Here](https://bcguzy.github.io/Brandons-Responsive-Weather/)  
I started this project as an experiment and exploration into web design and APIs. The site uses bootstrap CSS, openweathermap API for the weather data, and owfont for the icons. During the process of making this website, I learned a lot about using REST APIs, responsive web design, JavaScript, and HTML. My knowledge of APIs and HTML gained from this project helped me with future projects in the Summer.  
  
## Digital Clock

Fall 2019  
This project was made as part of my ESE123 Intro to Computer & Electrical Engineering class at Stony Brook. It is a digital clock with alarm and USB power supply for charging a phone or other device. This project was a great introduction to electronics; I learned about electronic components like resistors, LEDs, capacitors, and integrated circuits. I also was able to work on my soldering skills and programming skills with the project.
