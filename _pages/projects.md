## [Brandon's Responsive Weather](https://bcguzy.github.io/Brandons-Responsive-Weather/)

Summer 2020 - [Source Code](https://github.com/bcguzy/Brandons-Responsive-Weather)  
I started this project as an expiriment and exploration into web design and APIs. I knew nothing about web design or APIs at the start of it, and ended up with a basic but functional website. I chose openweathermap for the data source because its API was well documented and it allowed a large volume of free API calls each day. I was able to find an open source font called owfont that could be used to display the weather codes output from the API as icons on a page. I had struggles with getting the design to be responsive meaning getting it to look good on both phones and desktops, but after doing some research I found bootstrap css which allowed me to easily make the website responsive to browser width using their premade stylesheets. I learned a lot about using REST APIs and combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make a website.
