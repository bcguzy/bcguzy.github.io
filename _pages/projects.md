## Wifi Weather Sprinkler  
Summer 2020 - [Source Code](https://github.com/bcguzy/Weather_Sprinkler)  
This was my main project during the summer and combined the knowledge gained from previous API and hardware projects this summer. It takes rainfall data from the OpenWeatherMap API to determine if a plant needs more water that day or not. I used an ESP8266 NodeMCU, the motor shield for the ESP8266 for easy power delivery, a 9 volt battery for a power source, and a 9v solenoid valve to control water flow. This could be further miniturized by using only the ESP8266 chip without the development board and using a small power management board instead of the full motor shield.

Summer 2020 - [Source Code](https://github.com/bcguzy/Brandons-Responsive-Weather)  
I started this project as an experiment and exploration into web design and APIs. I knew nothing about web design or APIs at the start of it, and ended up with a basic but functional website. I chose openweathermap for the data source because its API was well documented and it allowed a large volume of free API calls each day. I was able to find an open source font called owfont that could be used to display the weather codes output from the API as icons on a page. I had struggles with getting the design to be responsive meaning getting it to look good on both phones and desktops, but after doing some research I found bootstrap css which allowed me to easily make the website responsive to browser width using their premade stylesheets. I learned a lot about using REST APIs and combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make a website.
