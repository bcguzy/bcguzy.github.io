## How Big is my Game Library?
Fall 2020  
This project aims to leverage the video game platform Steam and their API to quantify a user's game library in physical terms. Users are known to amass libraries of hundreds of games on the platform so it will be a fun exercise to quantify this in physical terms. It will also help me to familiarize myself with another API and work on my web design skills. The statistics will be like how long the library would be if you lined up every game disk, how much volume the game boxes will take up, and time based statistics like how many total hours of play the account has accrued.
