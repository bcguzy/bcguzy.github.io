## Wireless Thermostat for Space Heater
Fall/Winter 2020  
This project aims to create a wireless thermostat for controlling the power to a Space Heater across the room. This is so that the temperature can be accurately measured from across the room and is not too hot from being directly next to the space heater. I plan on using the ESP8266 for this project in conjunction with a Wi-Fi smart plug.
