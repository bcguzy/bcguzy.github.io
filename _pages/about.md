# Summer 2020: APIs and Hardware Applications
I spent the summer of 2020 learning how to use APIs. I love the idea of taking the vast amounts of information from the internet and applying it to something new or interesting. I started with the basics of a simple weather website and worked my way up to a plant sprinkler that can adapt to the weather.

This was my main project during the summer and combined the knowledge gained from previous API and hardware projects this summer. It takes rainfall data from the OpenWeatherMap API to determine if a plant needs more water that day or not. I used an ESP8266 NodeMCU, the motor shield for the ESP8266 for easy power delivery, a 9 volt battery for a power source, and a 9v solenoid valve to control water flow.
